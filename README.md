- Users can add new books or view all books in the library.
- Library administrators can add, view, and remove books. They can also add users to the application.
- The application supports two roles: User and Library Administrator.

## Technologies Used
- Java (Client-Server architecture)
- Collections framework and/or database for server-side storage

## Minimum Functionalities
1. User registration and login
2. Adding and viewing books for users
3. Adding, viewing, and removing books for library administrators
4. Basic demonstration with at least 3 users, 1 library administrator, and 6 created books

## Technical Standards
- Client and server are separate, communicating through a defined interface.
- Server uses collections framework and/or a database.
- Documentation includes a detailed description of the client-server interface and functional/non-functional features (Javadoc, Md file, etc.).
